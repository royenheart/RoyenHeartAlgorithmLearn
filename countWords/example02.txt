Abstract Cellular automata are simple mathematical systems that exhibit very complicated
behaviour. They can be considered as discrete dynamical systems or as computational
systems. Progress has recently been made in studying several aspects of them. Twenty central
problems that remain unsolved are discussed. Many of the complicated systems in nature
have been found to have quite simple components. Their complex overall behaviour seems
to arise from the cooperative effect of a very large number of parts that each follow rather
simple rules. Cellular automata are a class of mathematical models that seem to capture the
essential features of this phenomenon. From their study one may hope to abstract some
general laws that could extend the laws of thermodyamics to encompass complex and
self organizing systems. There has been recent progress in analysing some aspects of
cellular automata. But many important problems remain. This paper discusses some of the
ones that have so far been identified. The problems are intended to be broad in scope, and
are probably not easy to solve. To solve any one of them completely will probably require a
multitude of subsidiary questions to be asked and answered. But when they are solved,
substantial progress towards a theory of cellular automata and perhaps of complex systems
in general should have been made. The emphasis of the paper is on what is not known: for
expositions of what is already known about cellular automata, see [l-41. The paper
concentrates on theoretical aspects of cellular automata. There is little discussion of models
for actual natural systems. But many of the theoretical issues discussed should have direct
consequences for such models.
